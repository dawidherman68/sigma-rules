# 🔍 Sigma Rules Repository | Security Detection

Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my personal **Sigma Rules Repository**, where I share detection rules crafted primarily for cloud environments (Azure ☁️), but also including detections for Windows 🪟, Linux 🐧, Firewall 🔥, Network 🌐, and other key security areas.

## 🚀 What's Inside?

* **Cloud Detection Rules (Azure)**: Specializing in identifying privilege escalations, unauthorized access, and malicious activities in cloud infrastructures.
* **Endpoint Detection (Windows/Linux)**: Rules to detect suspicious processes, malware, persistence mechanisms, and lateral movement.
* **Network & Firewall**: Focused on detecting suspicious network behaviors, data exfiltration, unusual traffic patterns, and firewall bypasses.

## 🎯 Why Sigma?

Sigma rules help security teams quickly integrate reliable detection logic across multiple SIEM platforms (e.g., QRadar, Splunk, Sentinel). My goal is to contribute to the security community by creating actionable, high-quality detection rules to protect organizations effectively.

## 👥 Who is it for?

* **Security Engineers & Analysts** looking for reliable detections.
* **Managers & Recruiters** seeking insight into practical security skills and knowledge areas.
* **Anyone passionate about cybersecurity!** 🔐

Feel free to explore, use, and contribute! Let's make the cybersecurity world safer together! 🌍
